## ADX Splash Preview

This repo now includes a small Vite/React scaffold that mounts the `ADXSplash` experience for interactive preview.

### Run locally

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
3. Open the printed localhost URL (default `http://localhost:5173`).

> Note: The sandbox used to generate this commit could not reach npm (`403 Forbidden` on registry requests), so the preview cannot run here. Running the steps above in a regular environment with internet access will show the splash screen UI.

dznray4/dznray4 is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
