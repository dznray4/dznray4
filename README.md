Hi, I'm a 30 year old arcade maintenance man that apparently doesn't know how to spell. I tend to outfit myself in Dark gray colored jackets and sometimes suede jackets with uniform pants. I enjoy plucking the strings on the guitar in the back on my down time and watching people from behind the scenes. My struggle would find it's way around to me when the economy and my living situation took a turn for the worst. My position as an Arcade maintenance man slowly faded away. Leaving me to struggle finding a new career that interested me.
